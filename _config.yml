  bio_en: "One day, I came across the Chinese translation of The Ego is the Enemy, but after reading it, I didn't fully grasp many of the feelings and ideas it conveyed. I knew that sometimes it's necessary to refer to the original text. Then, one day, while reading the Diamond Sutra, it suddenly struck me — if the ego is the enemy, then no ego means no enemy. From the perspective of Chinese culture, the state of non-self is a profound philosophical realm, and I have many reflections on this subject. I thought to myself — it's time I started writing them down."
